# Ranker 🎯

Ranker is a web application that allows users to **create rankings** and **vote on rankings made by others**. For now, the project will focus only on the **Frontend** part, while the backend may be introduced in future versions.

## 📌 Roadmap

### Version 0.0.1 — Data Foundations
The first step is to build a **data management interface** to visualize and manipulate the core entities.
- **UI Features**: View, create, edit, and delete entities (Rank, Tier, Option, Vote, Assignment).
- **Data Storage**: Use in-memory storage.
- **Goal**: Ensure all entities can be created and managed manually through the UI.

### Version 0.0.2 — Towards the Real App
Transition from pure data management to the early structure of the final app.
- **UI Features**: Begin implementing the real ranking interactions (assigning Options to Tiers within Votes).
- **Entity Expansion**: Add optional descriptions and images to Ranks, Tiers, and Options.
- **Goal**: Bridge the gap between raw entity management and the ranking experience.

### Version 0.0.3 — Data + Users
Introduce a **basic user concept** to associate entities with users, still within the context of data management.
- **User Ownership**: Ranks and Votes belong to a user. Only the user can edit their own Ranks and Votes.
- **Guest Mode**: Guests can view data but cannot create or edit entities.
- **Storage**: Move from in-memory to Firebase for persistence and syncing.
- **Goal**: Simulate multi-user data management with external storage.

### Version 0.0.4 — UI & Customization Enhancements
Focus on making the experience more appealing and flexible.
- **UI Enhancements**: Improve layouts, design, and usability.
- **Customization Options**: Entities can have colors and configurable backgrounds.
- **Goal**: Move towards a polished user interface.

### Version 0.0.5 — Responsive Experience + External Storage
Prepare the app for broader use.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure layouts and components adapt to desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- **Blind Voting Mode**: Enable users to vote **without seeing all options upfront**. Options are revealed **one by one**, and the user votes sequentially.
- **Goal**: Deliver a usable app that stores and syncs data beyond the local browser while introducing novel voting interactions.

### Version 0.0.6 – AI-Powered Rank Creation
Leverage artificial intelligence to assist users in building richer Ranks.
- **AI-Generated Tiers & Options**: Automatically propose tiers and options based on the Rank’s title and description.
- **Smart Suggestions**: Offer AI-driven recommendations while editing or refining Ranks.
- **Goal**: Simplify the Rank creation process and inspire users with intelligent defaults.

## ⚙️ Technical Documentation

### 📌 Domain Model

The domain model describes the main entities of Ranker and their relationships.

![Domain Entities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrunoMNDantas/Ranker/main/docs/DomainEntities.png)

### **Rank**
Represents a ranking definition.

**Attributes**
- `id: string`
- `creationDate: Date`
- `title: string`
- `description: string`
- `imageUrl: string`

**Relationships**
- **has many** `Tier`
- **has many** `Option`
- **has many** `Vote`

**Example**: Rank = "Best Programming Languages"

---

### **Tier**
Defines a level or category inside a Rank.

**Attributes**
- `id: string`
- `rankId: string`
- `creationDate: Date`
- `order: number`
- `title: string`
- `description: string`
- `imageUrl: string`

**Relationships**
- **belongs to** `Rank`
- **used by** `Assignment` to map `Option` → `Tier` within a `Vote`

**Example**: Tiers = `S`, `A`, `B`, `C` (with `order` controlling vertical position)

---

### **Option**
An item that can be classified into a Tier.

**Attributes**
- `id: string`
- `rankId: string`
- `creationDate: Date`
- `order: number`
- `title: string`
- `description: string`
- `imageUrl: string`

**Relationships**
- **belongs to** `Rank`
- **used by** `Assignment` to map `Option` → `Tier` within a `Vote`

**Example**: Options = `Java`, `Python`, `JavaScript` (with `order` supporting custom listing)

---

### **Vote**
A user’s submission for a Rank (one completed arrangement of Options into Tiers).

**Attributes**
- `id: string`
- `rankId: string`
- `creationDate: Date`

**Relationships**
- **belongs to** `Rank`
- **includes many** `Assignment`

**Example**: A user’s vote for "Best Programming Languages".

---

### **Assignment**
Links an `Option` to a `Tier` **within a particular `Vote`**.

**Attributes**
- `id: string`
- `voteId: string`
- `tierId: string`
- `optionId: string`
- `creationDate: Date`
- `order: number`

**Relationships**
- **belongs to** `Vote`
- **belongs to** `Tier`
- **belongs to** `Option`
- **maps** `Option` → `Tier` in the context of a single `Vote`

**Example**: Assignments: `(Python → S)`, `(Java → A)`, `(JavaScript → B)` where the `order` can preserve the left-to-right placement within the Tier.
